# IPL Data Analysis and Prediction (2008–2024)

## About
This project is about analyzing IPL matches from 2008 to 2024.  
We studied player performances, team results, toss decisions, and venue trends.  
We also built prediction models and made an interactive dashboard using Power BI.

---

## What We Did
- Cleaned and prepared IPL datasets
- Found top players, best teams, and scoring patterns
- Made graphs and charts using Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Grouped players and teams with clustering
- Used simple and multiple linear regression for predictions
- Built a dashboard in Power BI to explore the results

---

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- Power BI Desktop
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## Files in This Project
- `matches.csv` – match information
- `deliveries.csv` – ball-by-ball details
- `ipl.ipynb` – main analysis notebook
- `ipl.html` – exported notebook
- `top_players.csv`, `venue_scores.csv` – prepared data files
- `PowerBI_Dashboard.pbix` – dashboard file

---

## How to Run It
1. Download or clone this project.
2. Install the libraries if you need to:
   ```
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```
3. Open `ipl.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook and run it.
4. Open `PowerBI_Dashboard.pbix` in Power BI to see the dashboard.

---

## Future Work
- Add live IPL match predictions
- Try advanced machine learning models
- Build a web app for the dashboard
